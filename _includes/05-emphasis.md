It's often difficult for me to talk about my own skills, probably because I'm so *modest*. In all seriousness, I'm an **excelent collaborator**, with years of experience as a **team leader** in different professional settings. I'm *proficient* numerous programming languages and libraries, including **C#**, **Ruby** (with experience using Ruby on Rails of course), **JS** (with JSON, Angular and all of those goodies), **Java**, **Python**, **PHP** and **SQL**. I'm very well verses in **MVC**, **RIAs** and many other formats for creating interactive websites. I've worked extensively in *database structuring and manipulation*. I'm a *fast learner* and a *self motivated* individual whose never afraid to *take initiative*. I'm also a *team player* and excellent *listener*. In fact, **communication** is one of my most powerful skills and it comes to me naturally.
